## Pricing Notes

- The script attempts to pull **current** S3 Standard storage pricing via the **AWS Pricing API** per bucket region.
- If pricing could not be retrieved for a region, it falls back to common S3 Standard tier rates.

### Pricing Source by Region

| Region | Pricing Source |
|---|---|
| `us-east-1` | Fallback rates (Pricing API did not return a clear match) |

## Notes

- Sizes are computed by summing object sizes via `ListObjectsV2` pagination (read-only).
- Very large buckets may take significant time to enumerate.
- Cost totals exclude buckets that returned errors during sizing.
